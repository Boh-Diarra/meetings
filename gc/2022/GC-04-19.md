### Discussion: [stringrefs](https://github.com/wingo/stringrefs) [20 minutes]

FM: Don't think it's true that JS strings are 16-bit code units. V8 has all kinds of strings, not all are 16 bit.

AW: Logically they are 16-bit code units, but e.g. single-byte encodings can be used as an optimization.

FM: I don't understand the comment about strings in GC memory because IT can already do zero-copy in the presence of provably immutable strings.

CW: But the component model might not be able to prove immutability.

TL: Let's not get hung up on details.

LW: When moving strings from the host to the module there is no way to avoid a copy with just IT.

ZB (chat): Couldn't it be enough to have immutable arrays + component model?

CW: Agree that the existence of a mature string representation in Wasm is a good reason to have stringrefs. But we will probably have immutable i16 arrays in raw GC, so probably not necessary to focus on immutability as a reason for existence.

FM: Some languages will have to bring their own GCs. Will be similar with strings.

AW: Yes, and good to take those into account in goals for string proposal.

FM: What are the other operations on strings that you think are important besides passing them between JS and Wasm?

AW: Depends on language. For example, Java wants O(1) indexing into code points. Creating strings from linear memory and writing them to linear memory is important. For example Rust would want to eagerly turn strings into UTF-8 so it can inline further operations. Also iterating over code points and code units.

FM: One of the pain points the J2CL team encountered is regex. This is a higher-level API than accessing a code point.

AW: Plan is to prototype with J2CL using their current scheme of depending on JS Regex.

GG: For clarification, we currently use re2j rather than native regex. We plan to next test by crossing the boundary to native JS regex with all the copying that will entail and after that we will be able to experiment with stringref to measure its performance.

ZB (chat): Isn't zero-copy interop with browser APIs more important than JS?

JK (chat): Zalim: "same thing". If one works, so does the other :)

ZB (chat): Jakob: is it "same thing" in all engines? 

JK (chat): all browsers are used to passing strings back and forth between JS and browser APIs, so I guess "yes"

FM: At the beginning you said something about the module boundary being a source of inefficiency. Supposing this was not true, how would that affect the design?

AW: Hard question. WebAssembly implementations have not gone down the path of cross-module optimization.

FM: V8 is definitely going in that direction.

AW: Even with cross-module inlining, there are still dynamic checks, unpredictability in the form of where your code is used and where it will need to be inlined. Could end up megamorphic over string representation.

AM: If stringref is a library, who ships it? The browser or the user?

FM: Good question. Multiple possible answers. One of the things about the stringref proposal is that it is much higher level than the machine instructions.

SC (chat): bulk memory is also not constant time right?

FM (chat): which, IMO, is a ding on those instructions.
LH (chat): and hardware has variable-time instructions (string ops, vector ops)

TL: Could be standardized at the JS or Web platform layers.

ASC: For Dart, one of the most interesting things is to be able to declare string literals.
GG: Could you have your literals on the JS side?

ASC: We have lots of constant objects like arrays, maps, sets. And the components of those need to be constant and should include strings. Declaring the strings externally would prevent them from being constant and prevent containers that include them from being constant.

CW: Are these constants protected at the type level?

ASC: Yes, they are declared as const in the code and syntactically they can only contain other constants. They are immutable, so modification operations will throw on the constants.

CW: Trying to get at what would go wrong if the consts included external strings. It would work but you would give up some optimizations?

ASC: Right. The big issue is that constants are declarative in the module. It is theoretically possible to generate code to dynamically generate these things rather than declaring them. A previous implementation did that and changing it to use declared constants was about 20% improvement to code size and runtime.

TL: What if we could declare string data but otherwise use imports? Then we could use externref as the handle and off the web there could be similar versions that use i32 as a handle.

CW: For global initializers to be able to point at a data segment and create a string out of it, we would need a language-level instruction for that.

GG: Do we expect this proposal to make it more optimal to pass types across the boundary when they are modified on the JS side?

AW: For example, converting to upper case. Anything that could change over time as unicode changes. Intl facilities. This proposal would allow you to do those modifications with zero copy.

FM: Is zero-copy the most important thing?

AW: Yes, it's close. Also nice to have a single string on the platform.

CW: The point that the platform has a single idea of what a string is makes it useful to raise that up to WebAssembly. This is different from bringing high-level language constructs down to WebAssembly.
